Rango Specifications (Tango with Django)


For the main page of the Rango website, your client would like visitors to be able to see:  


– the five most viewed pages; 
– the five most viewed (or rango’ed) categories; 
– some way for visitors to browse or search through categories. 


When a user views a category page, your client would like Rango to display: 
– the category name, the number of visits, the number of likes, along with the list of associated pages in that category (showing the page’s title, and linking to its URL); 
– some search functionality (via the search API) to find other pages that can be linked to  this category. 


For a particular category, the client would like: 
the name of the category to be recorded; 
the  number of times each category page has been visited; 
and how many users have clicked a  “like” button (i.e. the page gets rango’ed, and voted up the social hierarchy). 


Each category should be accessible via a readable URL - for example, /rango/books-about-  django/. 
Only registered users will be able to search and add pages to categories. Visitors to the site  should therefore be able to register for an account.
